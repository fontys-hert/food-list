Oatmeal a la apple pie:
- Oats 40 grams 
- Milk 200 grams (alternative: water)
- Apple small 1 piece
- Cinnamon... lots of Cinnamon

Cut the apples into small pieces. Put everything in one bowl. Put in the microwave, 600 watt for 3 to 4 minutes. Make sure you stir in between and regularly check if the liquid doesn't overflow, especially with milk!
